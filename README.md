Invictus
========

Static web files for the Invictus [website bounty](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1742.0).


## Requirements and Specs - [Full Details](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1742.0)

### Static Content
 Static Content or Basic PHP to manage headers/footers/language translation is preferred to systems dependent upon databases.  The site should load quickly and the content should be easily updated and versioned with github.  To test/deploy the site should be as simple as a git pull into the document root of a PHP enabled server.

### Multiple Language Support
Chinese + English minimum, but the more languages supported the better.

### Charts
Stock Charts and price quotes may be the only dynamic content

### Creative Freedom
Everything is up for change including logos for all products and the company itself.  We like the Invictus Horse, but do not want to put constraints on the creativity of the market.
