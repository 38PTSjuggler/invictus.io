						“Invictus makes unmanned companies like the aerospace industry makes unmanned vehicles. We release these autonomous entities into the wild and then do business with them like any familiar brick and mortar and flesh and blood (BMFB) company.”

						<h3>Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DACs)</h3>					
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								DACS are Distributed Autonomous Corporations. In contrast to centralized corporations that we know from every day life, with a company headquarters and a board of directors, DACs live 
								on the internet and emerge out of the interactions of the participating stake holders. Instead of going into brick and mortar stores you can interact with it everywhere you have an internet connection.
								Not only the physical location is distributed; decision making, research and development (R&D) and even record keeping takes place in the network. These DACs, and all the services and value they stand for, emerge from just a basic set of rules.
								With it there is no central control; they are autonomous. This sounds complex but you probably partake as a shareholder in DACs already.
							</p> 
							
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								The best known example of a DAC is Bitcoin. It is not just an internet currency, but an autonomous network providing a service to everyone who participates. The service it provides is 
								a trustworthy, easily accessible, not controllable, source of truth. In Bitcoins case this is the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain">blockchain</a> where transactions are saved. 
								When you connect to the network you use the services of all the miners who have worked or work on the blockchain to maintain it. These miners get rewarded for their investments and work with a payout of shares. 
								The same is true for the Alt-Coins. These Alt-Coins offer a wide range of services. Miners and participants 'vote' by picking a DAC and an implementation of it. This has resulted in networks which shares are sometimes valued at hundreds of dollars.
								A further analysis of Bitcoin as a DAC can be found <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/#.UjjO0mTFT7v">here</a>.

					<h3>Invictus Innovations</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">
							Invictus Innovations has embraced the concept of DACs. We see the possibilities that these DACs can offer their stakeholders. Our vision is that DACs don't have to be limited to virtual currencies. 
							There can be news organisations, investment banks, exchanges and many more applications run as distributed autonomous corporations. This will provide value to both the user and stakeholders/investors.
							Development of these applications costs resources and to fund the development of these DACs we have developed <a href="protoshares.com">Protoshares</a> and  <a href="#">Angelshares</a>. Protoshares (PTS) raises capital by crowd funding. 
							Angelshares are the investors equivalent of Protoshares. If there is a new DAC idea that we as Invictus Innovations 'launch' in the market, it will be split it off from ProtoShares. In effect, owning ProtoShares will give you some stake in every DAC Invictus Innovations will release.

						<h3>A new age:</h3>
					
						Distributed Autonomous Corporations have many advantages.  DACs are...<br><br>
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
							<li>Corporations – They are, and of a right ought to be, free and independent persons.</li>
							<li>Autonomous – once up to speed; they no longer need (or heed) their creators.</li>
							<li>Distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.</li>
							<li>Transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all as all transactions are visible.</li>
							<li>Confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.</li>
							<li>Trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.</li>
							<li>Fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders’ interests.</li>
							<li>Self-regulating – they obey the rules set for them like, well, robots.</li>
							<li>Incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.</li>
							<li>Sovereign – over their digital resources.  They don’t need governments to exist.</li>
						</ul>

						Metaphorically, DACs work very much like familiar brick and mortar corporations.<br><br>
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
							<li>They can be non-profit, for-profit or both at the same time!</li>
							<li>You can access their products and services on-line.</li>
							<li>You can buy and sell their stocks and bonds.</li>
							<li>Shareholders can earn dividends; bondholders can earn interest.</li>
							<li>Behaviors, rules and by-laws can only change by stakeholder majorities.</li>
						</ul>
