			<h3>What are Angelshares?</h3>					
			<p style="text-align: justify;">								
				AngelShares, like ProtoShares, represent a way to gain a stake in the new crypto-equity industry.  
				ProtoShares acknowledge a contribution to the launch of the new industry, representing a proof
				of work done in generating public interest.  AngelShares acknowledge an equally important financial
				contribution to the industry infrastructure.
			</p>

			<h3>Shares in DACs</h3>	
				<p style="text-align: justify;">								
				Both ProtoShares and AngelShares rely upon the willingness of developers to honor those contributions
				with shares in the DACs they develop.  We expect a Social Consensus to form in the marketplace about
				what constitutes honorable developer behavior. ProtoShares and AngelShares constitute concrete 
				documentation of what benefits developers received from those who laid the industry foundation.  
				Shares in individual DACs are concrete way for developers to acknowledge and reciprocate those benefits.
				How the market responds to a new DAC will depend upon how well that DAC is perceived to have honored 
				the emerging Social Consensus.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
				We see a consensus beginning to form around the following principles: 
				(a) Developers should seek a reasonable balance between equal-opportunity lotteries and ways to compensate
				those who sacrifice their savings or labor. (b) The market needs to give developers freedom to raise 
				funds to develop, support and promote their new DACs.  We believe that the following allocation represents
				the minimum fair genesis allocation.
				</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
				<li>10% of the crypto-equity should be allocated to holders of ProtoShares.</li>
				<li>10% of the crypto-equity should be allocated to holders of AngelShares.</li>
				<li>80% of the crypto-equity should be customized to the needs of each DAC.</li>
				</ul>

								<h3>How to acquire Angelshares?</h3>

				5000 of them will be available to ProtoShare holders. 5000 of them will be available to Bitcoin holders. That's ultimately 2,000,000 total shares, just like ProtoShares.
