						<h3>What is Keyhotee?</h3>					
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Keyhotee is a platform for taking back control of your digital life.  Phonetically named after the heroic <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote">Don Quixote de la Mancha</a>, Keyhotee invokes the unconquerable spirit 
								of a once and future era.
							</p>
							
						<h3>Keyhotee is the guardian of your privacy</h3>	
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Keyhotee integrates and defends your on-line identity, your reputation, your communications,  and your crypto-transactions.
								The alternative is trusting the very people who claim the right to own and exploit every bit of data you let them touch. 
								Keyhotee seamlessly blends emerging trust-free applications with trustless (and therefore trustworthy) replacements for everyday applications we have sadly discovered we cannot really trust.
							</p>	
							
						<h3>Keyhotee is your identity manager</h3>	
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
							Your good name is valuable.  You rely on it when you want someone to trust you. Keyhotee-ID lets you trade on that good name without exposure to those who would use it against you. 
							Now you can confirm your identity and reputation without exposing the information needed to steal or counterfeit it -- to anyone.  Your Keyhotee-ID is a name you choose to refer uniquely to you for all time.  
							No more fiddling with long, awkward, cryptic public keys.
							</p>
							
						<h3>Keyhotee is your new email</h3>	
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								It connects you directly to the person you are addressing by Keyhotee ID without revealing the relationship or contents to anyone. 
								 There is no outside email server where your passwords, personal identifying information, and private communications are stored, monitored, catalogued and exploited against your interests.  
							</p>
							
						<h3>Keyhotee is your new checkbook</h3>	
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
							 Now you can send and receive payment attachments to your emails easier than writing or cashing a check.
							 Keyhotee manages your digital currency wallets for Bitcoin and many other specialty currencies. 
							 Keyhotee keeps track of every transaction you make -- in a ledger for your eyes only.  
							 These transactions go directly to and from your designated party using their Keyhotee-ID. There is no third party watching in the middle. Ever.
							</p>	
							
						<h3>Keyhotee is your new chat</h3>	
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
							 Just as with email, Keyhotee lets you chat with your associates by their Keyhotee ID in real-time -- with no one recording or listening in.  
							 Every word is encrypted and you don't even have to think about it.  
							</p>
